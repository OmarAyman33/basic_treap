# Treap Implementation

A minimal templated C++ Treap supporting fast insert, erase, search, split, and range queries.  
It maintains BST order by key and heap order by priority for expected `O(log n)` operations.
This Treap does not use lazy propagation and implicit indexing(whatever that means). 
## Features
- Templated Treap structure
- Insert / Erase / Search
- Split and rangeQuery
- Copy constructor
- Inorder traversal
